## Local Setup

You can run the frontend locally isolated using an instance of the Trailmenu
backend on your machine. Follow the instructions on this page to set up a local
version of both services. More information on the Trailmenu backend can be found
in the repo README of the Trailmenu service.

### Node

To run the frontend node must be installed. We recommend to use `nvm` for
managing different versions of node in different repos. A Node version file
functionality will be introduced at a later time for this repository. Use
`npm install` in the root directory of this repository to install the required
dependencies.

### Angular

Angular is the frontend framework for this project. It is recommended to use VS
Code for development and to install the in `/.vscode/extensions.json`
recommended extensions for the IDE.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The
application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Running with local backend

### CI Pipeline

### Deployment

This app is deployed directly from the GitHub main branch and is rolled out
immediately. You can visit it at [app.pbrenk.com](https://app.pbrenk.com)

### Production

Everyone is welcome to use the app but must first be approved by me to avoid
malicious users. You can go to the register page and register with a username
and password and if by the username I will see that your use case is justified I
will approve you. For example if your username is
`recruiterAtACompanyIJustAppliedTo` I will approve. If it is `hacker123` I will
likely not approve.
