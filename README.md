## Local Setup

You can run the frontend locally isolated using an instance of the trailmenu backend on your machine. Follow the instructions on this page to set up a local version of both services. More information on the trailmenu backend can be found in the repo README of the trailmenu service.

### Node

To run the frontend node must be installed. We recommend to use `nvm` for managing different versions of node in different repos. A Node version file functionality will be introduced at a later time for this repository. Use `npm install` in the root directory of this repository to install the required dependencies.

### Angular

Angular is the frontend framework for this project. It is recommended to use VS Code for development and to install the in `/.vscode/extensions.json` recommended extensions for the IDE.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
